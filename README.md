**Turn your running Outlook Desktop into a READ-ONLY MCP server.** No Microsoft Graph API, no Entra app registration, no OAuth tokens — just your local Outlook and the authentication you already have.

Any MCP client (Claude Code, Claude Desktop, etc.) can then read emails, browse your calendar, view tasks, and list attachments — all through your existing Outlook session.

> **Note:** This is a read-only fork of [Aanerud/outlook-desktop-mcp](https://github.com/Aanerud/outlook-desktop-mcp). All tools that create, modify, or delete Outlook items have been removed.

## Quick Start

**1. Install** (requires Python 3.12+):

```bash
pip install outlook-desktop-mcp
```

**2. Register with Claude Code:**

```bash
claude mcp add outlook-desktop -- outlook-desktop-mcp
```

**3. Open Outlook and start a Claude Code session.** That's it — tools are available immediately.

## How It Works — Platform Routing

When the server starts, it checks which operating system it is running on and takes one of two paths:

```
                        outlook-desktop-mcp starts
                                  |
                          sys.platform check
                         /                  \
                   "win32"                "darwin"
                      |                      |
              ┌───────┴────────┐    ┌────────┴────────┐
              │  server.py     │    │  server_mac.py   │
              │  COM Bridge    │    │  AppleScript     │
              │  (15 tools)    │    │  Bridge          │
              │  READ-ONLY     │    │  (11 tools)      │
              │                │    │  READ-ONLY       │
              └───────┬────────┘    └────────┬─────────┘
                      |                      |
              OUTLOOK.EXE via         Microsoft Outlook
              COM / STA thread        via osascript
                      |                      |
              Exchange / M365         Exchange / M365
```

**Both paths use your locally running Outlook app and its existing authenticated session.** No cloud credentials, no Graph API tokens — the server inherits whatever account Outlook is signed into.

### Why two paths?

Windows Outlook (Classic) exposes a rich COM automation interface — the Outlook Object Model (`MSOUTL.OLB`). This has been the standard way to programmatically control Outlook on Windows for over 20 years. It provides deep access to mail rules, categories, MAPI properties, and the full folder hierarchy.

Mac Outlook does not support COM. Instead, it exposes an AppleScript dictionary that can be driven via the `osascript` command. The AppleScript interface covers the core operations — email, calendar, tasks — but does not expose rules, categories, or certain advanced MAPI features. This is a limitation of what Microsoft chose to include in Outlook for Mac's scripting dictionary, not a limitation of this project.

The server is structured as two parallel implementations with identical tool names and signatures, so MCP clients see the same interface regardless of platform. Tools that are not available on a given platform are simply not registered.

## Requirements

### Windows

- **Outlook Desktop (Classic)** — the `OUTLOOK.EXE` that comes with Microsoft 365 / Office. The new "modern" Outlook (`olk.exe`) does **not** support COM
- **Python 3.12+**
- **Outlook must be running** when the MCP server starts

### macOS

- **Microsoft Outlook for Mac** — version 16.x or later
- **Python 3.12+**
- **Outlook must be running** when the MCP server starts

#### Required macOS permissions

The first time a tool runs, macOS will show **two permission prompts** that you must approve:

1. **Privacy & Automation** — a system dialog asks: *"python3.12 wants to control Microsoft Outlook"*. Click **Allow** to let the server send AppleScript commands to Outlook.

2. **Accessibility** — to read your Exchange/M365 inbox, the server uses macOS UI scripting (System Events). This requires Accessibility access for `python3.12`:
   - Open **System Settings > Privacy & Security > Accessibility**
   - Find **python3.12** in the list (it appears after the first prompt)
   - Toggle it **on**

   Without Accessibility enabled, calendar, tasks, and local folder tools will work, but listing Exchange inbox messages will return empty results.

Both permissions are one-time setup — macOS remembers them for future sessions.

## Architecture Details

### Windows: COM Bridge (`com_bridge.py`)

All Outlook COM operations run on a dedicated thread using the Single-Threaded Apartment (STA) model, as required by COM. The async MCP event loop dispatches tool calls to this thread via a queue and awaits results, keeping COM threading rules respected and the MCP protocol non-blocking.

```
MCP tool call (async)
  → bridge.call(func, args)
    → queued to STA thread
      → func(outlook, namespace, args) executes on COM thread
    → result returned via threading.Event
  → JSON response back to MCP client
```

Each tool's inner function receives the live `Outlook.Application` and `MAPI.Namespace` COM objects and works directly with the Outlook Object Model — `GetItemFromID`, `CreateItem`, `Items.Restrict` with DASL filters, and so on.

### macOS: AppleScript Bridge (`applescript_bridge.py`)

Each tool call builds an AppleScript string and executes it as a subprocess via `osascript`. There is no persistent connection — every call is stateless.

```
MCP tool call (async)
  → build AppleScript string
    → asyncio.create_subprocess_exec("osascript", "-e", script)
    → parse stdout text into structured data
  → JSON response back to MCP client
```

Each tool constructs a single AppleScript that fetches all needed data in one `osascript` call (no per-message subprocess loops). Results come back as delimited text, which the server parses into the same JSON structure the Windows server produces.

**Key differences from Windows:**

- Entry IDs on macOS are **numeric** (e.g. `42`), not hex strings. They identify items within their folder context.
- Folder references use AppleScript's **locale-independent keywords** (`inbox`, `sent items`, `drafts`, `deleted items`) rather than localized folder names.
- Search uses a two-stage approach: AppleScript's `whose` clause pre-filters by subject, then sender and body are checked per-message inside the AppleScript loop (avoiding large data transfers). Date range filtering runs in Python. Body text is only fetched when explicitly searched (to avoid overhead). The script timeout increases to 60s for loop-filtered searches.
- User input is escaped for safe embedding in AppleScript strings to prevent script injection.

## Install from Source

### Windows

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Aanerud/outlook-desktop-mcp.git
cd outlook-desktop-mcp
python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\activate
pip install pywin32 "mcp[cli]" -e .
python .venv\Scripts\pywin32_postinstall.py -install
```

Register from source using the launcher script:

```bash
claude mcp add outlook-desktop -- powershell.exe -Command "& 'C:\path\to\outlook-desktop-mcp\outlook-desktop-mcp.cmd' mcp"
```

### macOS

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Aanerud/outlook-desktop-mcp.git
cd outlook-desktop-mcp
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install "mcp[cli]" -e .
```

Register from source:

```bash
claude mcp add outlook-desktop -- /path/to/outlook-desktop-mcp/.venv/bin/python -m outlook_desktop_mcp
```

## Usage Examples

Once registered, just talk to Claude naturally:

- *"Show me my 10 most recent inbox emails"*
- *"Read the email from Taylor about MLADS"*
- *"What's on my calendar this week?"*
- *"Search for emails about the quarterly report"*
- *"Find emails from Mueller in the last two weeks"*
- *"Search my inbox for emails mentioning 'invoice' in the body"*
- *"Save the attachment from that email to my Downloads folder"*
- *"What tasks are due this week?"*

Windows-only examples:

- *"What categories do I have?"*
- *"List my mail rules"*
- *"Am I set as Out of Office?"*
